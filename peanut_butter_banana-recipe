Ingredients:
 - Jar of peanut butter
 - Banana

Directions:
 1. Get a knife
 2. Open jar of peanut butter
 3. Begin peeling banana, but not all the way so you have somewhere to hold onto.
 4. Use the knife to spread a glob of peanut butter onto the tip of the banana.
 5. Bite off the tip of the banana.
 6. Repeat until the banana is gone (remember to keep peeling as you go)
